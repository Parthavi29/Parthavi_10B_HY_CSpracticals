    <h1>Welcome to Wild Haven Animal Park!</h1>
    <h3>At Wild Haven, we believe in the power of education and conservation. Our park spans over 150 acres of beautifully landscaped habitats, each designed to mimic the natural environments of our resident animals. From the lush savannas of Africa to the vibrant rainforests of South America, our carefully curated exhibits provide visitors with an immersive experience that highlights the beauty and diversity of wildlife.</h3>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <h4> Our mission is to inspire a deep appreciation for wildlife and the natural world while promoting conservation efforts both locally and globally. We aim to educate visitors about the challenges many species face and encourage responsible stewardship of our planet.
    </h4>
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <h4>Wild Haven Animal Park was founded in 1995 by wildlife enthusiasts and conservationists who shared a common goal: to create a sanctuary that educates the public about wildlife while promoting conservation efforts. Starting with just a handful of rescued animals, the park quickly grew in both size and reputation. Over the years, we have expanded our collection to include over 200 species from various habitats around the world. <br> In 2005, Wild Haven received accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), a recognition that highlights our commitment to the highest standards of animal care, conservation, and education. Our park has since become a vital hub for wildlife preservation and education in the community, hosting numerous outreach programs and events that engage visitors of all ages.</h4>
